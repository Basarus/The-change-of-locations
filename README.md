# The-change-of-locations

this script allows you to automatically change locations. to enable the script, you must place the client folder in your client-side and call it with the alt.emitclient(player, 'ls:toggle') key);

After that, you can switch groups with the up and down arrows, and the locations themselves with the left and right arrows.

also, there are some coordinates commented out, which will spawn into empty space (but there are definitely some locations there). If you adjust these coordinates and put them as an addition to this script, I will be very grateful to you!
